Building a gcc cross-compiler for i386-elf

The document describes how to build a cross-compiler for i386-elf target on Solaris/SPARC 2.6.  (The same instructions will likely work with other versions of Unix as well.)

Get the files:

gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz
binutils-2.10.1.tar.gz
newlib-1.9.0.tar.gz
gcc and binutils are available from any GNU ftp mirror.  newlib is available from any Redhat sourceware mirror.

Unpack them from the same directory (referred to here as $source_dir).  Create a directory in which to install the software (referred to here as $install_dir).

Download the following file into $source_dir: http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/tools/patches/ecos-gcc-2952.pat

Commands to run

cd $source_dir
mkdir build-binutils
cd build-binutils
../binutils-2.10.1/configure --prefix=$install_dir --target=i386-elf -v
gmake all install
cd ..

cd gcc-2.95.2
patch < ../ecos-gcc-2952.pat
cd ..
mkdir build-gcc
cd build-gcc
export PATH=$install_dir/bin:$PATH
../gcc-2.95.2/configure --prefix=$install_dir --target=i386-elf \
  --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --with-newlib \
    --with-headers=$source_dir/newlib-1.9.0/newlib/libc/include
    gmake all install
    At this point we can build GeekOS!

    NOTE: you can specify --enable-languages=c to the gcc configure command in order to avoid building the c++, java, f77, etc. front-ends.

    It might be useful to actually build newlib, but it's not required for GeekOS.
