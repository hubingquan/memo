To duplicate a repository without forking it, you can run a special clone command, then mirror-push to the new repository.

Before you can duplicate a repository and push to your new copy, or mirror, of the repository, you must create the new repository on GitHub. In these examples, exampleuser/new-repository or exampleuser/mirrored are the mirrors.

Mirroring a repository

Open Terminal.

Create a bare clone of the repository.

git clone --bare https://github.com/exampleuser/old-repository.git
Mirror-push to the new repository.

cd old-repository.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/new-repository.git
Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.

cd ..
rm -rf old-repository.git

Mirroring a repository in another location

If you want to mirror a repository in another location, including getting updates from the original, you can clone a mirror and periodically push the changes.

Open Terminal.

Create a bare mirrored clone of the repository.

git clone --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/repository-to-mirror.git
Set the push location to your mirror.

cd repository-to-mirror.git
git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/exampleuser/mirrored
As with a bare clone, a mirrored clone includes all remote branches and tags, but all local references will be overwritten each time you fetch, so it will always be the same as the original repository. Setting the URL for pushes simplifies pushing to your mirror. To update your mirror, fetch updates and push.

git fetch -p origin
git push --mirror
